# concourse-k0sctl

It's a container image, publicly available on Docker Hub, and a simple, configurable Concourse-CI pipeline example to base your own images and pipelines on. This is neither production ready nor intended to be run in security sensitive settings. It may improve over time. Feedback, ideas and any other contribution welcome.
